                <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
                <p>
                    After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                    Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to
                    get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and
                    meet like-minded peers.
